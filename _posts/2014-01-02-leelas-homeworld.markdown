With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! We're rescuing ya. No, she'll probably make me do it.

## The Farnsworth Parabox


It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh&hellip; also, comes with double prize money. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Belligerent and numerous. And when we woke up, we had these bodies.


- Bender, this is Fry's decision&hellip; and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.
- But I've never been to the moon!
- You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?

### The Problem With Popplers

Your best is an idiot! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!

#### Lesser of Two Evils

Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.


- You can see how I lived before I met you.
- Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.
- As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

##### A Head in the Polls

Take me to your leader! But existing is basically all I do! I love you, buddy! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!
